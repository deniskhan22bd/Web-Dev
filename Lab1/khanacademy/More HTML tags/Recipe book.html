        <p><strong id="step1">Step 1:</strong> Rinse the rice for Uzbek pilaf in a cauldron with cold water, changing it several times until the last water becomes completely clear. The rice is ready.</p>

        <p><strong id="step2">Step 2:</strong> Wash and cut lamb for pilaf into cubes. Peel 3 onions and the entire carrot. Slice the onion into thin half-rings and the carrot into long sticks with a thickness of 1 cm. Peel the garlic without separating the cloves.</p>

        <p><strong id="step3">Step 3:</strong> Heat the cauldron, pour in oil, and heat it until a light smoke appears. Add the remaining onion and fry it well until it turns dark golden. Remove the onion from the cauldron.</p>

        <p><strong id="step4">Step 4:</strong> Prepare the "zirvak" (base for Uzbek pilaf). Put the sliced onion into the cauldron and, stirring, fry it until it becomes dark golden for 5-7 minutes. Make sure it does not burn.</p>

        <p><strong id="step5">Step 5:</strong> Add the sliced lamb to the onion. Stirring with a spatula, fry the zirvak ingredients until they have a brownish crust. This may take about 10–15 minutes.</p>

        <p><strong id="step6">Step 6:</strong> Place the cauldron with the meat and onion to the side, add the carrot. Fry without stirring for 3 minutes. Then mix all the contents of the cauldron and cook for another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally with a spatula.</p>

        <p><strong id="step7">Step 7:</strong> Prepare the spice mix by crushing cumin and coriander with your fingers or a pestle. Add it to the zirvak along with barberries and salt to taste. You can add a bit more salt than you're used to since the rice will absorb some.</p>

        <p><strong id="step8">Step 8:</strong> Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the carrots become soft, 7–10 minutes. Pour 2 cm of boiling water into the cauldron. Add a hot pepper. Reduce the heat and stew the zirvak for 1 hour.</p>

        <p><strong id="step9">Step 9:</strong> Rinse the rice again, let the water drain. Spread the rice evenly over the zirvak in the cauldron, increase the heat to the maximum, and pour boiling water through a colander into the cauldron to cover the rice with a 3 cm layer.</p>

        <p><strong id="step10">Step 10:</strong> Once all the water is absorbed, press garlic cloves into the rice (halfway). Reduce the heat to medium and cook until the pilaf is ready under a lid.</p>

        <p><strong id="step11">Step 11:</strong> Make holes in the pilaf by tapping the rice lightly with a spoon. If the sound is dull, make several punctures with a thin stick to the very bottom. This allows steam to escape through the holes.</p>

        <p><strong id="step12">Step 12:</strong> Cover the cauldron with a large flat plate and a lid, reduce the heat to a minimum, and leave the pilaf on the heat for 30 minutes.</p>

        <p><strong id="step1">Step 1:</strong> Prepare the pork for roasting. Wash it and pat it dry with paper towels. Peel the garlic cloves. Cut large cloves into long slices, leave small ones whole.</p>

        <p><strong id="step2">Step 2:</strong> Prepare the spice mix for the pork. Place sweet paprika, juniper, rosemary, cloves, coriander, and chili flakes in a mortar. Crush with a pestle. Add oil and mix well.</p>

        <p><strong id="step3">Step 3:</strong> Lay the pork on the table. Make deep incisions in the meat with a thin knife. Insert half of the garlic cloves into the incisions. Flip the meat to the other side and pierce it with the remaining garlic.</p>

        <p><strong id="step4">Step 4:</strong> Rub the pork with salt, then coat it with the spicy oil mixture from all sides. Wrap it in plastic wrap and leave it at room temperature for 1–1.5 hours.</p>

        <p><strong id="step5">Step 5:</strong> Preheat the oven to 200°C. Remove the plastic wrap from the pork and wrap the meat in foil. Place it on a baking sheet and roast for 1.5 hours. Serve hot.</p>
